## Context
This is a curated list of resources that were very helpful to me in my early days as an offering manager (OM)/product manager (PM) and that I find helpful for *sharpening the saw* no matter the role on product teams.  These are links I tend to share over and over based on specific requests for help.

## For any role; everyone is a leader!
