## Context
* From one of my CAST (Conference of the Association for Software Testing) 2014 presentation slides entitled *Emptiness: Finding my maps*.  
* This is a mind map I used with one of my team's as we planned our test approach for each sprint. This was for a platform team that had not yet moved to a continuous integration/continuous delivery pipeline. Also, the squads within the team were at different maturity levels of Test Driven Development. And though we had a smoke test/sanity check list, in this small team context where we moved quickly, a 10-page test plan to be revised every week did not make sense for us.  We used this as inspiration to *fill in the blank canvas*, to collectively paint a picture of prioritized test coverage areas.
* Read about my [2014 CAST session here:](https://cast2014.sched.com/event/1jWLzJH/beyond-bewilderment)
* I also recommend Lisa Crispin's [Agile Testing Quadrants:](https://lisacrispin.com/2011/11/08/using-the-agile-testing-quadrants/) as a map for your team to use for test strategy.
