## Background

This is the curriculum I created for an offering manager (OM) student intern.  This project resulted in a new application feature and gave the intern hands-on experience in an agile development team with UX, engineers, and data specialists, making iterative, demonstrable progress in two-week iterations.  I was the product owner (a.k.a. OM) for this application which served external and internal users. I was one of a team of three folks who served as the intern's mentor.  At the end of the month and a half internship, we were able to extend them a full-time offer and they accepted!

## Onboarding checklist 
1. Read and watch internal enablement materials to get an overview
1. Use this link to get access
1. Read the application *Glossary*, *What's new*, and *FAQs*
1. Schedule a 30-minute introductory walkthrough/live demo session with me

## Project 
**Goal:** Design, develop, deliver an in-app smart walkthroughs using WalkMe  
**Value:** Firsthand agile development project experience  
**Skills:** Agile development practices   

## Measures
1. Gather project requirements and translate into an epic (or epics) on the ZenHub backlog.
1. Confer with OM and fellow dev teammates on approach and design through ideation, backlog grooming, definition of done with measures for success, i.e. usage analytics.
1. Create measures for feature usage via analytics. *e.g. How often is a given user repeatedly using features since they completed the WalkMe walkthrough? How often are users starting the walkthrough then dropping and where are they dropping?*
1. Pair programming with fellow dev teammates as needed for project delivery.
1. Lead feature acceptance and sign-off sessions.
